- uses decentralized storage if possible
- scripts which automate my life
- scripts which automate life of whom i infuence directly and can create named scripts
- sketch links into script, even if not working yet, for automation
- i may be several me in roles so several subfolders
- so there should be some exact important targets to automate
- do, repeat, automate
- do automate from start if source is automatable, think if you will do it again soon
- only open source automation tools
- as more native tools as possible
- when possible native mature and widely available command line tools should be called
- binaries only to boostrap
- if target goes stale it migrated to archive in same folder stucture, not deleted (the rule of this repo)
- does not use dead or dying langs
- stucture speaks of itself, no need to write description
- folders are taxonomy
- never try to autome all and all world as it is chaos of environemnts-people-versions-rules-rights
- be very concrete in folder names about environment-versions-domains, copy paste for new but similar set
- dot not automate very specific which may be installed only oncd upong time and already for new version

- in case of  in `path` conflict rename to less conflicted
