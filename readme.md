Next guideline is used for all installaton code above:
- when possible native mature and widely available command line tools should be called
- no ad-hock scripting intermeidate lagnuages used, like `.cmd` `.bat` `.vbs`
- `PowerShell` is used to bostrap `Chocolatey` and `F#`
- `F#` used for all possible scripts as language which provides 
- because`F#` provides scripting editing experince when needed, but generating more sustainable texts
- because `F#` can be statically compiled into `.dll` for fast lean execution
- `F#` is expressibe for many embeding Domain Specific Lanauges 
- not custom formatted texts like `.reg`, but `xml` `json` `yaml`


Same for `Linux` - no dynamic lagnuages for scripting like `.py`, bash, Ruby, LISP. May be `go` will go.

TODO:
- rewrite ps1 and reg and vbs files with F#
